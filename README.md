#Final Project 
##Intro to Programming with C++
###Optimization of Marginal Profit (mill operations)
#### Genesis of the Project
The newly promoted general manager of a local iron mill faced several challeges when the previous manager quit:
  1. The flotation tank damage from overload
  2. The EPA injunctions for excessive moisture content in the tailings
  3. The SAG mill damage from improper feed rates of grinding material, raw ore, and water
  4. Meeting different market demands (foreign and domestic markets)
  5. Relying on density samples as a management tool indcuces significant lag-time 
  6. New (and current) employees needed more advanced skills in physics and math
The GM wanted a realtime management tool for plant operations
The company wanted the college to develop a "mining math and science" course

####Possible solutions a real time management tool:  
  1. One solution: install sensors costing as much as $50 million dollars in time and equipment
  2. A second solution: develop a mathematical model and statistical analysis tool

####Road blocks
  1. The mine was already in financial hardship, so installing sensors was not possible
  2. In the local mining culture, experience is valued over education, so highering a mining engineer was unlikely to happen
  
####The compromise
The mine decided to sponsor the GM to meet with me for help with the physics and mathematical requirements of his job first.
