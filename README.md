#Final Project 
###Intro to Programming with C++
##Optimization of Marginal Profit (mill operations)

####Summary
This is the first part of a work in progress that would require additional collaboration with the general manager and CFO of a mine. However, it does contain the first two programs for a systems operations and planning tool for an iron. operations. 

#### Genesis of the Project
The newly promoted general manager of a local iron mill faced several challeges when the previous manager quit:
  1. The flotation tank damage from overload
  2. The EPA injunctions for excessive moisture content in the tailings
  3. The SAG mill damage from improper feed rates of grinding material, raw ore, and water
  4. Meeting different market demands (foreign and domestic markets)
  5. Relying on density samples as a management tool indcuces significant lag-time 
  6. New (and current) employees needed more advanced skills in physics and math
The GM wanted a realtime management tool for plant operations
The company wanted the college to develop a "mining math and science" course

####Possible solutions for a real time management tool:  
  1. One solution: install sensors costing as much as $50 million dollars in time and equipment
  2. A second solution: develop a mathematical model and statistical analysis tool

####Road blocks
  1. The mine was already in financial hardship, so installing sensors was not possible
  2. In the local mining culture, experience is valued over education, so highering a mining engineer was unlikely to happen
  
####The compromise
The mine contacted the college to see if I could develop a Mining Math and Science course for their employees and help the GM with the math and science requirements of his new job. I visited the mine several times to get familiarized with the equipment, systems, and operations of the mill. The GM came to the college several times to develop his math and science skills. As we collaborated, we realized that the mill needed a three part training program. Part one was to develop and implement the curriculum for a basic Math and Science course for all employees. Part two was to develop and implement intermediate and advanced courses for floor supervisors and plant managers. Part three was to develop the management tool for plant operations.

####What actually happened
The plant was is such disarray from not being able to manage the flow of slurry throughout the plant that they were overloading one peice of equipment after another. So, the emphasis for my meetings with the GM changed from building curriculum to developing a real time management tool that could integrate and support their current operational software. We developed the formulas for the first three peices of the tool and an outline for the last two. 

####Current status
Shortly after beginning the collaboration with the mill's GM, the mine suffered two catastrophic breakdowns from miss-managing the mill operations, which of course is precisely what they were trying to avoid. These breakdowns along with the fact that the mine was already leveraged to the hilt financially, largely from the purchase of new equipment and contract issues, eventually caused the mine to shut down. This left me with a half finished product, which I shelved and mostly forgot about. However, in the back of my mind, I kept thinking that this couldn't be the only small mine in the world facing these challenges. I thought if someone would pick up where I left off and could develop a program to run my formulas, it would be marketable software. A year later I decided to start the coputer science program at the college. This seemed like the perfect thing for my final project in my introductory C++ course.

####Conclusion
For my project, I completed programs for the first two peices of the management tool. The third piece would require additional collaboration and the last two would require a long term commitment to gathering specific statistical data on mining operations and finances. The two programs calculate the volume of grinding material in the SAG mill and its circulating load. The third piece is a system of equations that calcualtes the volume and density of the lurry in each pathway throughout the mill.
